**Answer**:  
Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) allows you to interact with your database using Python code instead of writing SQL. Models in Django are Python classes that map to database tables.

### 8. **How do you define a model in Django?**
**Answer**:  
A Django model is a Python class that subclasses `django.db.models.Model`. Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    published_date = models.DateField()
```

---

### 9. **What are migrations in Django?**
**Answer**:  
Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes made to models (adding fields, deleting fields, etc.) into the database schema. You create migrations using:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
And apply them using:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### 10. **How can you query data using Django ORM?**
**Answer**:  
Django ORM allows you to retrieve data using methods like `all()`, `filter()`, and `get()`. Example:
```python
# Retrieve all records
books = Book.objects.all()

# Filter by a specific field
python_books = Book.objects.filter(author='John Doe')

# Get a single object
book = Book.objects.get(id=1)
```

---

### 11. **Explain Django Admin.**
**Answer**:  
Django provides a built-in admin interface that allows CRUD operations on models. To use it, you need to register your models in `admin.py`:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Book

admin.site.register(Book)
```

---

### 12. **What are Django Views?**
**Answer**:  
Views handle the logic of the application. In Django, views are Python functions or classes that receive a web request and return a web response. Example of a function-based view:
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```

---

### 13. **What are Django templates?**
**Answer**:  
Templates define the structure or layout of HTML files. They allow embedding dynamic data using Django’s template language. A simple template:
```html
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<p>{{ content }}</p>
```

---

### 14. **How do you render templates in Django?**
**Answer**:  
You can use the `render()` method to pass data to templates and return an HTML response. Example:
```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    context = {'title': 'My Page', 'content': 'Hello, World!'}
    return render(request, 'my_template.html', context)
```

---

### 15. **How do you handle static files in Django?**
**Answer**:  
Django provides a way to handle static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images using the `STATIC_URL` setting. You must also include `django.contrib.staticfiles` in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
```

---

### 16. **What are middleware in Django?**
**Answer**:  
Middleware are hooks in Django that process requests and responses. Each middleware component performs specific functions such as authentication, session management, or request/response processing.

---

### 17. **What is CSRF protection in Django?**
**Answer**:  
Django includes protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by using a CSRF token in forms that post data. You can use the `{% csrf_token %}` tag in templates to include the token in your forms.

```html
<form method="POST">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <!-- Form fields here -->
</form>
```

---

### 18. **What are class-based views (CBVs)?**
**Answer**:  
Class-Based Views provide an object-oriented approach to handling views. They provide built-in functionality such as `ListView`, `DetailView`, and `CreateView`. Example:

from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Book

class BookListView(ListView):
    model = Book
    template_name = 'books/book_list.html'
```

---

### 19. **What are function-based views (FBVs)?**
**Answer**:  
Function-based views (FBVs) are views written as Python functions. They take an HTTP request and return an HTTP response. Example:
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
```

---

### 20. **How do you configure URL routing in Django?**

In Django, you configure URL routing in the `urls.py` file. Example:
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

---

### 21. **How to create forms in Django?**
**Answer**:  
Django provides a `forms` module for creating forms in Python. Example:
